* Facilitate the **unlocking of books** by correctly answering the magical questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **Backend:** PHP (version 8.1 or higher recommended), Laravel
* **Database:** MariaDB
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Repository:** GitHub

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project in your local environment:

**Prerequisites:**

* PHP (version 8.1 or higher recommended)
* Composer (PHP dependency manager)
* MariaDB (or MySQL) installed and running
* Git

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git clone https://github.com/TEAM3-ED9/magical-bookstore-api.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd magical-bookstore-api
    ```

3.  **Verify the PHP version:**

    ```bash
    php --version
    ```

    Ensure you have PHP version 8.1 or higher.

4.  **Verify the Composer version:**

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

    Ensure you have Composer version 2.x installed.

5.  **Install Composer dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

6.  **Configure the database connection:**

    * Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    * Open the `.env` file and configure the database environment variables (DB\_CONNECTION, DB\_HOST, DB\_PORT, DB\_DATABASE, DB\_USERNAME, DB\_PASSWORD).

7.  **Generate the Laravel application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

8.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

9.  **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üê≥ Docker Installation

If you prefer to use Docker for an isolated development environment, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* Docker installed on your operating system.

**Docker Installation Steps:**

1.  **Verify the Docker version:**

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

    Ensure you have Docker version 20.x or higher.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TEAM3-ED9/magical-bookstore-api.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd magical-bookstore-api
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    * Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    * Open the `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables.

5.  **Configure environment variables for the MariaDB database (if necessary):**

    Copy the `.env-example` file in `Application/MariaDB/` to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp Application/MariaDB/.env-example Application/MariaDB/.env
    ```

    This is an example for a MariaDB enviroment
    ```bash
    MARIADB_USER=admin
    MARIADB_PASSWORD=idontknow
    MARIADB_DATABASE=bookstore
    MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=ravenclaw
    ```

    Open the `Application/MariaDB/.env` file and configure the database environment variables.

    This is an example for a Laravel enviroment
    ```bash
    DB_CONNECTION=mariadb
    DB_HOST=db
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=bookstore
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=ravenclaw
    ```

6.  **Create folders for volumens in the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    mkdir Application/{db_vol,log}
    ```

    This will creates folder db_val and log inside **Application** folder

    ```bash
    mkdir Application/log/{apache,db,php}
    ```

    This will create folders apache, db and php inside **log** folder

7.  **Change permission to Application folder to have access to the volumen:**

    ```bash
    chmod -R 755 Application
    ```

8.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    This will build the Docker images (if it's the first time) and run the containers in the background.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the server is running (either locally or with Docker), you must enter in the php container:
```bash
docker exec -it php bash
``` 
and run:
```bash
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```
After that, you must be able to see the project at `http://localhost`.

To interact with the API, consult the interface (API) documentation in `docs/interface-agreement-api.md` to learn about the available endpoints, HTTP methods, and data formats.
